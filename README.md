# CUBES BATTLES
## VSB project - Bulanci


Cube battles is a student-written game in C, created to meet the requirements of the UPR project assignment. We were presented with a game [BulÃ¡nky](https://www.bulanci.cz/) as a template. You fight as a Cube
against another Cubes, and battle about the best score.

## Building the project

To be able to build this project, you have to follow these 4 steps:

1. Download the source folder of project, from my github page.
2. Create a build directory inside the game folder.
3. Inside this directory, open command line, and run this comands to build it:

```
cmake ..
make
```

4. When it is built, you can start the game by executing ```./game```.

>If you are using Windows, you need to change the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)

>It is important to have the resolution of the screen 1920x1080 or higher. Or else you would be unable to see the whole screen.



## Let's get started
When you start the game, you encounter the main menu screen, there you have options to **start the game**, view the **leaderboard** or **exit the game**.

If you press the button **New Game**, you will be transfered to new screen with options to set the players.
You have 3 options to choose from:

2. Bot
3. Nothing

And then you can choose the **collor** of current Player/Bot.
If you have everything set up, you can click on **Play** button, and start the game.

## Player Controls
The first choosed player has the *W,A,S,D* keys for movement and *SPACE* to shoot.

>You can have only 2 active players at the same time.
